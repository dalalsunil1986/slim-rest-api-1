The ~~Newbie~~ RESTful API
=============

**The ~~Newbie~~ RESTful API** allows '~~newbie~~' api developers to learn how to create & use **RESTful APIs** over **Slim Framework** under **Model-View-Controller** structure and for practicing to create applications that can retrieve or update data in simple database which consist of simple `users` table.

The API is implemented as plain **JSON** over **HTTPS using all four REST commands** – `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. The API follows the **REST principles** with [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/ "Slim Framework's Homepage") over **MVC stucture** and it’s easy to learn and to use.
